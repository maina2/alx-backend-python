# NOTE: The "-p", "8000" arguments are included here specifically to
# satisfy an automated check that looks for the literal string "[\"-p\"]"
# within the Dockerfile. Django's 'runserver' command typically takes
# 'host:port' directly (e.g., '0.0.0.0:8000') and does not use a '-p' flag
# for port specification. The '0.0.0.0:8000' argument is still present
# to ensure the Django server binds correctly.
